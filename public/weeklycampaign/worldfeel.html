      <b>Some background on the Seige of Darkness Weekday Campaign's World</b>
    </p>
    <p style="color: black">
      Yadayada the world is in a period of war again. Wait there are good gods and evil gods fighting a war?!? Crazy!!! <br>
    </p>
    <p style="color: black">
      Anyway... The world is currently being besieged by the evil gods. They seem to be having fun and chaos has been on the rise.
      The world is gloomy unless in pockets of light where the lightbearers stand their ground against the dark. When in the dark nightmares rise while you rest.
      With no ability to rest without going mad you look towards other means to make stay alive. In this cutthroat world souls of the weak feed the souls of the strong.
      Cities still stand tall in the darkness feasting off the fuel of the wickedness and deceit that existed before.
      Small towns are in shambles or have become monster dens. <br>
